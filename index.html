  <h1>Arkham Horror & Eldritch Madness</h1>
  <p><strong>Reality crumbles, and you are left to piece together the screaming silence.</strong></p>
  <div class="description">
    Inspired by Arkham Horror and cosmic dread. A world where mystery, madness, and myth intertwine. Clues don‚Äôt just reveal answers‚Äîthey reveal the truth you wish you didn‚Äôt know.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üíÄ What Defines This World Type?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanity systems: fear, logic, and memory are all vulnerable to decay.</li>
      <li>Hidden layers: what you see is never the full picture.</li>
      <li>Encounters are often psychological rather than physical.</li>
      <li>Environments mutate subtly over time‚Äîarchitecture that shifts, timelines that bend.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üìö Worldbuilding Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a stable surface world‚Äîthen slowly unravel it.</li>
      <li>Use dreams, journals, and distorted memories to hint at deeper truths.</li>
      <li>Write characters that lie or forget things without realizing it.</li>
      <li>Use ordinary places as anchors: libraries, schools, alleyways‚Äîand twist them.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üßπ Narrative Hooks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A stranger insists they met you yesterday, but you‚Äôve never seen them before.</li>
      <li>Your house grows one new room every night. Nobody believes you.</li>
      <li>The town doesn‚Äôt appear on any maps‚Äîand you can‚Äôt seem to leave.</li>
      <li>Someone burned every book in the library‚Äîbut you remember reading them all.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üéÆ Game Design Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Branching sanity mechanics that alter what the player sees and hears.</li>
      <li>False clues and red herrings‚Äîsome placed by entities watching the player.</li>
      <li>Inventory systems tied to memory: forget an item, and it disappears.</li>
      <li>Rooms that loop, collapse, or echo decisions made earlier in the game.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
