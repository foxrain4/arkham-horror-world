  <h1>Arkham Horror & Eldritch Madness</h1>
  <p><strong>Reality crumbles, and you are left to piece together the screaming silence.</strong></p>
  <div class="description">
    Inspired by Arkham Horror and cosmic dread. A world where mystery, madness, and myth intertwine. Clues don’t just reveal answers—they reveal the truth you wish you didn’t know.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>💀 What Defines This World Type?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanity systems: fear, logic, and memory are all vulnerable to decay.</li>
      <li>Hidden layers: what you see is never the full picture.</li>
      <li>Encounters are often psychological rather than physical.</li>
      <li>Environments mutate subtly over time—architecture that shifts, timelines that bend.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📚 Worldbuilding Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a stable surface world—then slowly unravel it.</li>
      <li>Use dreams, journals, and distorted memories to hint at deeper truths.</li>
      <li>Write characters that lie or forget things without realizing it.</li>
      <li>Use ordinary places as anchors: libraries, schools, alleyways—and twist them.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧹 Narrative Hooks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A stranger insists they met you yesterday, but you’ve never seen them before.</li>
      <li>Your house grows one new room every night. Nobody believes you.</li>
      <li>The town doesn’t appear on any maps—and you can’t seem to leave.</li>
      <li>Someone burned every book in the library—but you remember reading them all.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🎮 Game Design Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Branching sanity mechanics that alter what the player sees and hears.</li>
      <li>False clues and red herrings—some placed by entities watching the player.</li>
      <li>Inventory systems tied to memory: forget an item, and it disappears.</li>
      <li>Rooms that loop, collapse, or echo decisions made earlier in the game.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🪸 Notable Entities (Pseudo-Monsters)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Eyeless Congregation</strong> – A shifting mass of robed figures who chant in reverse. They leave no tracks and cannot be seen in mirrors. They appear only when no one is looking directly at them.</li>
      <li><strong>Driftmire Womb</strong> – A gelatinous crater in the woods that hums with lullabies. If you listen too long, you may remember being born inside it.</li>
      <li><strong>Archivist of Bone</strong> – A librarian entity with too many hands and no face. It collects secrets written in blood and replaces your memories with entries from its own catalog.</li>
      <li><strong>The Hollow Frequency</strong> – A sound that shouldn’t exist, causing radios to bleed and dreams to repeat. Those exposed too long become unable to distinguish which timeline they’re in.</li>
      <li><strong>Carmine Roots</strong> – Vines that pulse like veins and grow only in basements. They whisper suggestions that feel like your own thoughts. One day you might wake up feeding them.</li>
      <li><strong>Mother of the Ink Sea</strong> – A blindfolded being who floats inches above water, trailing quills. It rewrites the past of anyone it touches—but the edits are always cruel.</li>
      <li><strong>Skelmourne Latch</strong> – A locked door that wanders across buildings. If opened, the person disappears, and their reflection starts living their life instead.</li>
      <li><strong>The Orphaned Choir</strong> – Heard but never seen. Their songs unmake nearby objects, erasing names, memories, and meaning itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Verdance of the Stolen World</strong> – A parasitic garden that mimics childhood dreams. Victims wander in, convinced they’re safe, until they take root.</li>
      <li><strong>The Knower Beneath</strong> – A subterranean entity that answers any question—but each answer must be paid with a memory you can never retrieve.</li>
      <li><strong>Hollow Prince of the Fourth Bell</strong> – An omen of storms and insanity. Always smiling, always behind you in photos. When the bell tolls, he visits.</li>
      <li><strong>Celestial Leech</strong> – Buried in the sky. Only visible during dreams. It feeds on hope and leaves stains on the stars.</li>
      <li><strong>Scriven of the Wrong Page</strong> – Appears whenever a book is misprinted. It reads the error aloud, and reality shifts to accommodate the new version.</li>
      <li><strong>Elegy of Skin</strong> – A song trapped in a vinyl record, said to peel identity from the listener. Often found in sealed basements of forgotten clubs.</li>
      <li><strong>Quaint God of Uneven Roads</strong> – Blesses lost travelers with visions of the future, but only the worst possible ones. It has hooves and no eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Barrowling Dusk</strong> – A fog-creature that mimics loved ones' voices to lure victims deeper into the mist. Always sounds just slightly off.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🗺️ Notable Locations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Crucible Hollow</strong> – A sinkhole of warped time. Clocks stop here, and compasses spin without rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Whisper Ridge Sanitorium</strong> – Condemned and sealed, yet screams still echo from inside.</li>
      <li><strong>The Grayed Orchard</strong> – Fruit that falls before ripening. Eating it makes your shadow linger behind.</li>
      <li><strong>The Salt-Hiss Chapel</strong> – Church submerged in fog. Choirs sing from beneath the water line.</li>
      <li><strong>Luminal Station</strong> – An abandoned subway station reachable only in dreams.</li>
      <li><strong>Gorehouse Flats</strong> – Empty houses where no lights work—but windows glow when no one is looking.</li>
      <li><strong>Silent Nest Motel</strong> – Staffed entirely by people who share the same face.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="footer">
    Madness doesn't come all at once—it creeps in with familiarity. Build a world that whispers first... and then screams.
